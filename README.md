# AllstateClaimsPredictionAtKaggle

I recently finished the AllState Severity Prediction at Kaggle.com and here I am sharing my code. 

I ended up at the 69th rank at private leaderboard earning my first Top 2.3% badge. My final score on the private Leaderboard was 1113.08079 and 1101.42100 for best public leaderboard.

The task was to help Allstate develop automated methods of predicting the cost, and hence severity, of claims. This has become an important and timely trend in the insurance industry. More accurate prediction of severity helps facilitate the claim service and improves customer satisfaction at the end.

This competition attracted more than 3000 individual participants and it was a hot and difficult one, from start to finish.

Here is a complementary writeup that I published at gitbook.com:
